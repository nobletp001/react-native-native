# Hire Me for Your Next Native, Kotlin, Swift, and React Native Project

## Step 3: Building Native Modules and Components

We are using **Codegen** and **Turbo** to build the native modules that communicate efficiently with React Native. These tools help automate the process of creating bindings between JavaScript and native code, ensuring smooth communication between the two layers.

### Native Modules We Are Building:

- **VideoPlayer**: A native module to handle video playback with enhanced features.
- **LocalToStage File System**: A module to manage file storage and interaction with the local file system.
- **Image Picker**: A module that allows for selecting images from the device's gallery or camera.
- **BottomSheet**: A native module to implement bottom sheet components for better user interactions.
- **FileSystem**: A native module for accessing and manipulating the file system on both Android and iOS.

### 3.1: Adding a Native Module for Android (Java/Kotlin)

#### Create the Native Module:
1. Navigate to `android/src/main/java/com/{yourproject}`.
2. Create a new Java/Kotlin class for your module. For example, `MyNativeModule.java`.
3. Extend `ReactContextBaseJavaModule` and override necessary methods.

#### Register the Native Module:
1. Open `MainApplication.java` (or `MainApplication.kt` for Kotlin).
2. Add your new module to the `getPackages()` method.

### 3.2: Adding a Native Module for iOS (Objective-C/Swift)

#### Create the Native Module:
1. Navigate to the `ios/{yourproject}` directory.
2. Create a new `.m` (Objective-C) or `.swift` (Swift) file for your module. For example, `MyNativeModule.m`.
3. Use the `RCT_EXPORT_METHOD` macro for methods you want to expose to JavaScript.

#### Link the Module:
1. If you're using Objective-C, ensure the module is added to the bridging header and properly linked in `AppDelegate.m`.

#### Test Native Methods:
1. Once your module is set up and linked, you can call it from JavaScript just like any other module in React Native.

### 3.3: Building a Native UI Component

#### Create a Custom UI Component for Android (Java/Kotlin):
1. In `android/src/main/java/com/{yourproject}`, create a new class extending `ReactViewGroup` or `SimpleViewManager` for the component.
2. Override necessary methods to render your custom view.

#### Create a Custom UI Component for iOS (Objective-C/Swift):
1. In the `ios/{yourproject}` folder, create a new `.m` or `.swift` file for your UI component.
2. Use `RCT_EXPORT_VIEW_PROPERTY` to expose properties to JavaScript.
3. Implement the `UIView` or `UIViewController` that your component represents.

#### Use the Native UI Component in React Native:
1. In your React Native app, import and use the new native component like any other React Native component.

## Step 4: Testing and Debugging

- **For Android:** You can test the changes on an Android Emulator or a connected Android device.
- **For iOS:** Similarly, use the iOS Simulator or a connected device.
- To ensure your native module or component is working, test it by calling it from JavaScript and checking for any errors.
