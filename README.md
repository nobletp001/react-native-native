## Why Use Native Modules and Components in React Native?

Native modules and components in React Native provide a powerful way to bridge the gap between JavaScript and the underlying platform (iOS or Android). While React Native offers a large set of cross-platform components and modules, there are times when you need to tap into platform-specific features or optimize performance. Here are some key reasons why native modules and components are used:

### 1. **Access to Platform-Specific Features**
   - Some features and APIs are not available through React Nativeâ€™s standard libraries. For example, deep integration with device hardware (e.g., camera, GPS, Bluetooth) or platform-specific libraries (e.g., media player) requires native code. By creating native modules, you can access these functionalities.

### 2. **Performance Optimization**
   - React Native applications may experience performance issues for resource-heavy tasks. Native modules allow you to offload heavy computation to native code (Java/Kotlin for Android, Swift/Objective-C for iOS), which is faster and more efficient than performing the same task in JavaScript.

### 3. **Better User Experience (UX)**
   - Native UI components can offer smoother, more performant experiences compared to purely React Native UI components. For example, creating complex animations or using platform-specific UI components can be done more effectively through native code.

### 4. **Reuse Existing Native Code**
   - If you already have native code (for example, a pre-existing native SDK, third-party library, or custom functionality), you can integrate it directly into your React Native app by creating a native module. This avoids the need to re-implement functionality from scratch in JavaScript.

### 5. **Faster Development**
   - Using native modules allows you to speed up development when building app features that require heavy native integration or are not available in the React Native ecosystem. With native modules, you can implement the feature quickly and efficiently.

### 6. **Full Platform Control**
   - By using native code, you have full control over platform-specific configurations, APIs, and optimizations. This is especially useful when dealing with low-level operations, performance tuning, or dealing with platform-specific bugs.

## Step 1: Building Native Modules and Components

We are using **Codegen** and **Turbo** to build the native modules that communicate efficiently with React Native. These tools help automate the process of creating bindings between JavaScript and native code, ensuring smooth communication between the two layers.

### Native Modules We Are Building:

- **VideoPlayer**: A native module to handle video playback with enhanced features.
- **LocalToStage File System**: A module to manage file storage and interaction with the local file system.
- **Image Picker**: A module that allows for selecting images from the device's gallery or camera.
- **BottomSheet**: A native module to implement bottom sheet components for better user interactions.
- **FileSystem**: A native module for accessing and manipulating the file system on both Android and iOS.

### 1.1: Adding a Native Module for Android (Java/Kotlin)

#### Create the Native Module:
1. Navigate to `android/src/main/java/com/{yourproject}`.
2. Create a new Java/Kotlin class for your module. For example, `MyNativeModule.java`.
3. Extend `ReactContextBaseJavaModule` and override necessary methods.

#### Register the Native Module:
1. Open `MainApplication.java` (or `MainApplication.kt` for Kotlin).
2. Add your new module to the `getPackages()` method.

### 1.2: Adding a Native Module for iOS (Objective-C/Swift)

#### Create the Native Module:
1. Navigate to the `ios/{yourproject}` directory.
2. Create a new `.m` (Objective-C) or `.swift` (Swift) file for your module. For example, `MyNativeModule.m`.
3. Use the `RCT_EXPORT_METHOD` macro for methods you want to expose to JavaScript.

#### Link the Module:
1. If you're using Objective-C, ensure the module is added to the bridging header and properly linked in `AppDelegate.m`.

#### Test Native Methods:
1. Once your module is set up and linked, you can call it from JavaScript just like any other module in React Native.

### 1.3: Building a Native UI Component

#### Create a Custom UI Component for Android (Java/Kotlin):
1. In `android/src/main/java/com/{yourproject}`, create a new class extending `ReactViewGroup` or `SimpleViewManager` for the component.
2. Override necessary methods to render your custom view.

#### Create a Custom UI Component for iOS (Objective-C/Swift):
1. In the `ios/{yourproject}` folder, create a new `.m` or `.swift` file for your UI component.
2. Use `RCT_EXPORT_VIEW_PROPERTY` to expose properties to JavaScript.
3. Implement the `UIView` or `UIViewController` that your component represents.

#### Use the Native UI Component in React Native:
1. In your React Native app, import and use the new native component like any other React Native component.

## Step 2: Testing and Debugging

- **For Android:** You can test the changes on an Android Emulator or a connected Android device.
- **For iOS:** Similarly, use the iOS Simulator or a connected device.
- To ensure your native module or component is working, test it by calling it from JavaScript and checking for any errors.
